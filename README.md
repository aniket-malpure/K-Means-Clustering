# K-Means Clustering Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) of equal variance.

## Overview

K-Means clustering is a popular method for cluster analysis in data mining. The algorithm aims to partition n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centroid).

## Features

- Implementation of the standard K-Means algorithm
- Visualization of clustering results
- Support for custom distance metrics
- Elbow method for optimal K selection

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for comparison and validation)
